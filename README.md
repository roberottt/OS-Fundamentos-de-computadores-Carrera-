# Operating System
This was my ARM based proyect for the Computer Fundamentals subject.

If you want to try, you'll need QEMU.

QEMU is an ARM's processor emulator. It's available for Linux and Windows

This project was made for the Windows version of QEMU.

Run it on Windows --> Just open a terminal (in the file's directory) and type compila.bat command, then type ejecuta.bat, and it is done.

Run it on Linux --> qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128M -nographic -kernel main.bin
